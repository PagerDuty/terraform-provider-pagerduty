# pagerduty\_webhook\_subscription

A [webhook subscription](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTkw-v3-overview) allow you to receive HTTP callbacks when incidents are created, updated and deleted. These are also known as V3 Webhooks.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "pagerduty_service" "example" {
  name = "My Service"
}

resource "pagerduty_webhook_subscription" "foo" {
  delivery_method {
    type = "http_delivery_method"
    url = "https://example.com/receive_a_pagerduty_webhook"
  }
  description = "%s"
  events = [
    "incident.acknowledged",
    "incident.annotated",
    "incident.delegated",
    "incident.escalated",
    "incident.priority_updated",
    "incident.reassigned",
    "incident.reopened",
    "incident.resolved",
    "incident.responder.added",
    "incident.responder.replied",
    "incident.status_update_published",
    "incident.triggered",
    "incident.unacknowledged"
  ]
  active = true
  filter {
    id = data.pagerduty_service.example.id
    type = "service_reference"
  }
  type = "webhook_subscription"
}

```
