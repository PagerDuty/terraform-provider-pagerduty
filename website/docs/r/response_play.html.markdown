# pagerduty_response_play

A [response play](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/v2/page/api-reference#!/Services/get_services) allows you to create packages of Incident Actions that can be applied during an Incident's life cycle.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "pagerduty_user" "example" {
  name  = "Earline Greenholt"
  email = "125.greenholt.earline@graham.name"
  teams = [pagerduty_team.example.id]
}

resource "pagerduty_escalation_policy" "example" {
  name      = "Engineering Escalation Policy"
  num_loops = 2

  rule {
    escalation_delay_in_minutes = 10

    target {
      type = "user"
      id   = pagerduty_user.example.id
    }
  }
}

resource "pagerduty_response_play" "example" {
  name = "My Response Play"
  from = pagerduty_user.example.email

  responder {
    type = "escalation_policy_reference"
    id   = pagerduty_escalation_policy.example.id
  }
  subscriber {
    type = "user_reference"
    id   = pagerduty_user.example.id
  }
  runnability = "services"
}
```
